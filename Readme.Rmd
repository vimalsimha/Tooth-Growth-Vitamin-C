title: "How Does Vitamin C Affect Tooth Growth In Guinea Pigs?"
output: github_document

Using inferential data analysis techniques on a dataset containing 60 observations of the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth) in guinea pigs that were administered different dosages of Vitamin C in two different ways, I find that the length of odontoblasts increases as Vitamin C dosage increases from 0.5mg to 2mg, and that direct administration of Vitamin C is more effective than Orange Juice.
